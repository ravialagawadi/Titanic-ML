# Titanic-ML

# Problem statement :
 use machine learning to create a model that predicts which passengers survived the Titanic shipwreck.
 
 # About Data variable : 
 
 The Survived variable is our outcome or dependent variable. It is a binary nominal datatype of 1 for survived and 0 for did not survive. 
 
The PassengerID and Ticket variables are assumed to be random unique identifiers, that have no impact on the outcome variable. Thus, they will be excluded from analysis.

The Pclass variable is an ordinal datatype for the ticket class, a proxy for socio-economic status (SES), representing 1 = upper class, 2 = middle class, and 3 = lower class.

The Name variable is a nominal datatype. It could be used in feature engineering to derive the gender from title, family size from surname, and SES from titles like doctor or master. Since these variables already exist, we'll make use of it to see if title, like master, makes a difference.
